# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
## Description
This is a stock price prediction project using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The goal of the project is to predict the closing price of a given stock based on historical price data. The model is implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical stock price data for a specific company (e.g., Google) from a CSV file. The data includes various columns such as date, open price, close price, high price, low price, volume, etc.
